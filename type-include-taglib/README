This is a simple implementation of a taglib that includes JSPs on given object types.

It is basically an open source implementation of the basic functionality that CoreMedia
provides with its cm:include Tag. This implementation however does not include "crazy"
caching or whatever.

The Taglib is included using using the following URI:
http://hastybox.com/taglib/typeinc

Simple usage example:

Lets say you have the following class:

class ArticleImpl extends ArticleBase implements Article {}

The library first tries to include an appropriate JSP for the given class of the instance (ArticleImpl).
If it could not find a JSP it searches for the Interface(s!!) (Article). And if that fails also it
searches for a JSP for the super class (ArticleBase). Then the cycle starts again until it
hits java.lang.Object and fails afterwards.
